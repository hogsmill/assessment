    <h3>
      Scrum Master Self-Assessment
    </h3>
    <p>
      We tell the team to use retrospectives to inspect and continuously improve themselves.
      But what about us as Scrum Masters? Shouldnâ€™t we take the time to reflect, identify our
      areas of improvement, and take actions to get better as Scrum Masters?
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking the time to reflect on yourself has a powerful effect. So, I invite you to
      take this self-assessment and discover new things about your professional you and your
      Scrum skills.
